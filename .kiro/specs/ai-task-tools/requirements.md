# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds three AI-powered tools to a Jira-like task management system: Smart Summary, Smart Estimate, and Smart Rewrite. The system will provide REST endpoints with deterministic AI responses (mocked), activity auditing for task changes, and minimal frontend integration contracts. The core entity is Task, with supporting models for TaskActivity and Tag.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an engineer, I want to get quick estimate guidance for tasks, so that I can plan my work more effectively without spending time researching similar past tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request a smart estimate for a task THEN the system SHALL return a suggested points value based on similar tasks
2. WHEN similar tasks exist with estimates THEN the system SHALL calculate the median estimate and return confidence â‰¥ 0.65
3. WHEN no similar tasks have estimates THEN the system SHALL suggest 3 points with confidence 0.40
4. WHEN calculating similarity THEN the system SHALL consider tasks with same assignee, overlapping tags, or substring matches in title/description
5. WHEN returning similar tasks THEN the system SHALL limit results to top 5 most recently updated candidates

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a PM, I want readable lifecycle summaries of tasks, so that I can provide stakeholder updates without manually reviewing activity logs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request a smart summary for a task THEN the system SHALL return a human-readable summary of the task lifecycle
2. WHEN generating the summary THEN the system SHALL mention the number of activities and current status
3. WHEN the task has multiple status changes THEN the system SHALL provide a narrative of the task progression
4. WHEN the summary is generated THEN the system SHALL return deterministic, mocked content

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want acceptance criteria scaffolding from task descriptions, so that I can create better test cases without starting from scratch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request a smart rewrite for a task THEN the system SHALL return an enhanced title and user story format
2. WHEN generating the rewrite THEN the system SHALL include acceptance criteria in the user story
3. WHEN the rewrite is complete THEN the system SHALL preserve the original task title
4. WHEN returning the user story THEN the system SHALL format it with "As a user, I want..." structure

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive task CRUD operations, so that I can manage tasks with proper validation and filtering.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a task THEN the system SHALL require a title and allow optional fields
2. WHEN updating a task THEN the system SHALL validate status enum values and estimate constraints
3. WHEN listing tasks THEN the system SHALL support filtering by status, assignee, and tags
4. WHEN paginating results THEN the system SHALL default to 20 items per page with max 100
5. WHEN deleting a task THEN the system SHALL perform hard delete with 204 response

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automatic activity logging for task changes, so that I can maintain an audit trail of all modifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task is created THEN the system SHALL log a CREATED activity
2. WHEN task status changes THEN the system SHALL log UPDATED_STATUS with before/after values
3. WHEN task assignee changes THEN the system SHALL log UPDATED_ASSIGNEE with before/after values
4. WHEN task estimate changes THEN the system SHALL log UPDATED_ESTIMATE with before/after values
5. WHEN task description changes THEN the system SHALL log UPDATED_DESCRIPTION with before/after values
6. WHEN multiple fields change in one update THEN the system SHALL create separate activities for each changed field
7. WHEN activities are created THEN the system SHALL make them immutable and chronologically ordered

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want tag management capabilities, so that I can categorize and organize tasks effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a tag THEN the system SHALL enforce unique names (case-insensitive)
2. WHEN listing tags THEN the system SHALL return them sorted by name
3. WHEN associating tags with tasks THEN the system SHALL support multiple tags per task
4. WHEN creating duplicate tag names THEN the system SHALL return 400 validation error

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want clear API contracts for AI tools, so that I can integrate the functionality with predictable responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling smart summary endpoint THEN the system SHALL return JSON with summary field
2. WHEN calling smart estimate endpoint THEN the system SHALL return suggested_points, confidence, similar_task_ids, and rationale
3. WHEN calling smart rewrite endpoint THEN the system SHALL return title and user_story fields
4. WHEN any AI endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL return deterministic mocked responses
5. WHEN authentication is missing THEN the system SHALL return 401 unauthorized

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system user, I want proper error handling and validation, so that I receive clear feedback when operations fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL return 400 with detail and field-specific errors
2. WHEN a task is not found THEN the system SHALL return 404 error
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return 401 error
4. WHEN title is empty on create THEN the system SHALL return validation error
5. WHEN estimate is negative THEN the system SHALL return validation error

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want performance optimizations and telemetry, so that the system scales well and I can monitor usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying tasks by status THEN the system SHALL use database indexes for performance
2. WHEN querying tasks by assignee THEN the system SHALL use database indexes for performance
3. WHEN AI endpoints are called THEN the system SHALL log invocations with task ID and response time
4. WHEN task details are requested THEN the system SHALL include activity counts for UI consumption
5. WHEN pagination exceeds 100 items THEN the system SHALL cap results at 100 items
